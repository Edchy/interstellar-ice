Hey! if you‚Äôve ever used GitHub, you‚Äôve probably heard of **SSH**.
Maybe you've even gone through the process of setting it up. But do you know what it actually is? 

I had a shallow understanding of it when i first started using GitHub, and I think a lot of people do. So I wanted to take a moment to break it down in simple terms.

SSH stands for **Secure Shell**, but what does that _actually_ mean? Well, it‚Äôs right there in the name ‚Äî a **protective shell** that wraps around your data as it sails through the murky, pirate-infested waters of the internet. Without it, digital pirates could plunder your ship and steal your treasure (read: your credentials). But with SSH, even if they intercept your data, they‚Äôre left staring at a locked chest ‚Äî encrypted and unreadable.





##  Why Developers Use SSH

When you use GitHub with SSH:

- You don‚Äôt need to enter your username or token every time.
- Your identity is confirmed automatically.
- Your connection is encrypted so nobody can eavesdrop.

It‚Äôs fast, safe, and feels like magic once it‚Äôs set up.



##  So What Does SSH Actually Do?

SSH has **two jobs**:

1. **Authentication** ‚Äì Prove that you are who you say you are (using a key pair).
2. **Encryption** ‚Äì Wrap the entire connection in secrecy so no one can spy on it.

So, it sort of acts like a **lock** and a **tunnel** at the same time:

- **Lock**: Only you and the server can open it.
- **Tunnel**: Everything inside is hidden from prying eyes.


##  How SSH Authentication Works

It‚Äôs all built on [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). Here‚Äôs the flow:

You generate a **key pair**:
   - **Public key** = the lock (safe to share)
   - **Private key** = the key (keep it secret, keep it safe üíç)


You give your **public key** to GitHub.

When you run something like `git push`, GitHub:
   - Sends a random [**challenge**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication) to your computer.
   - Your machine signs it with your **private key**.
   - GitHub checks that signature using your **public key**.

If it matches, GitHub knows:  
**‚ÄúOnly the real you could‚Äôve answered that.‚Äù**

Boom. You‚Äôre in ‚Äî and your private key never left your machine.


##  What Gets Encrypted?

**Everything sent through the SSH connection is encrypted**:

- Your Git commands
- Your commit data
- File diffs, branches, metadata ‚Äî all of it

But to be clear:

-  **In transit?** Yes, fully encrypted
-  **On GitHub?** Nope ‚Äî your code is stored as-is (unless it‚Äôs in a private repo)

So SSH protects the journey, not the destination.


##  Real-World Analogy

SSH is like shipping your code in a bulletproof armored van. Nobody can see inside or tamper with it while it‚Äôs moving.

Once it arrives at GitHub, it‚Äôs unpacked and put on the shelf.  
Whether others can see it depends on your repo‚Äôs privacy settings ‚Äî not SSH.



## SSH vs HTTPS

Both encrypt your connection and are safe to use

But here is how they differ:

	### **Auth Method**
	- SSH: Uses a key pair (no password needed after setup)
	- HTTPS: Uses a username + token (or password)

	### **Good For**
	- SSH: Automation and development workflows
	- HTTPS: Quick clone via browser or when you don‚Äôt want to set up keys

	### **Prompts**
	- SSH: No prompts after it‚Äôs set up
	- HTTPS: Prompts for credentials (token/password) regularly unless cached

##  Why SSH Is Cool

-  You never send a password
-  Your private key stays private
-  You only authenticate once per session
-  Your connection is encrypted end-to-end



## How to Set Up SSH

First, of all. Let's check if you already have some keys.

In a terminal, type:

```bash
ls ~/.ssh
```

This just means: 

"List all files in the ssh folder in my home directory ". 

`.ssh` is a **hidden folder** (notice the dot) inside your home directory where SSH keys and configurations are typically stored.


<InfoBox title="Whats with the little ~worm?~">
`~` This little guy is called a _tilde_. 

It‚Äôs a shortcut to your home directory on Unix-based systems (like macOS and Linux). So `~/.ssh` means ‚Äúthe `.ssh` folder in my home directory‚Äù, which on macOS is `/Users/yourusername/.ssh`. 

This convention dates back to early Unix shell design in the 1970s and 80s, where developers needed a fast, one-character way to refer to a user‚Äôs personal space on the system.
</InfoBox>

When i run this command, I see the following:
```bash
id_ed25519
id_ed25519.pub
```

This means i already have a key that i can use. Or i could choose to create another one (i'd just have to make sure to not overwrite the old one, by giving the new key a different name).

### Generate a New Key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/gitlab_key
```

ssh-keygen: this command comes pre-installed as part of OpenSSH that comes with macOS and Linux (i dont know about Windows, look it up or change to a mac)

 - **-t** ed25519: [key type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) (modern and secure)

 - **-C:** optional label (your email for example, used for reference)

 - **-f:** filename ‚Äî this is crucial! This is where you **avoid overwriting** your old key.

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter a passphrase (you can leave it empty, but adding one adds security).

Running `ls ~/.ssh`again now gives me this output:

```bash
id_ed25519
id_ed25519.pub
gitlab_key
gitlab_key.pub
```

As you might notice, the newly created keys have much more descriptive names than my old keys. This is because when i created the old key i didn't add the `-f ~/.ssh/gitlab_key`. So it just defaulted to a generic name. So make sure to give your keys good, descriptive names.

Also - as you might understand the - the `.pub` extension means the key is safe to share to the public. While the other one is **private** and should **never** leave your computer.

### Config it

If you use more than one SSH key ‚Äî say, one for GitHub and another for GitLab ‚Äî an SSH config file helps your computer know which key to use for each. Without it, things _might_ still work, but you could run into confusing errors or failed logins. The config just makes everything smoother and more reliable.

``nano ~/.ssh/config`` will create/open a config file in your ssh dir. 

Now, with my current setup, i would add something like this to my config file:


```nano
# GitHub
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# GitLab
Host gitlab.com
  HostName gitlab.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  ```

 **Host github.com:** This matches any command involving github.com, like git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git.
    
 **HostName github.com:** The actual hostname to connect to (can be different if using aliases).
    
 **User git:** This is the username you connect with. Git services use a shared user called git.
    
**IdentityFile** ~/.ssh/github_key: The **private key** file you want to use for this host.
    
**IdentitiesOnly** yes: Forces SSH to only try the key you specify, instead of cycling through all your keys (which can cause ‚ÄúPermission denied‚Äù errors).

### Test it
To test the connection i can type `ssh -T github.com`. If all is well you should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully connected".  

**Note:** I have already set up my public key on github. If you haven't. Here is what to do (i will use gitlab as an example):

- Copy your public key (be sure to not copy the private key):

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/gitlab_key.pub
   ```
   The output should look something like this:
   ```bash
   ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3... the_label_you_provided
   ```

- Select and copy it.
- Add it to the _key field_ in your SSH settings on gitlab. 
- Done.

( on mac you can run ```pbcopy < ~/.ssh/gitlab_key.pub```
instead - to get the whole key to your clipboard in one command)

### Test again
```bash
ssh -T git@gitlab.com
```

Now, if this is the first time you connect you should see something like this:
```bash
The authenticity of host 'gitlab.com (172.65.251.78)' can't be established.

ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:eUXGGm1YGsMAS7vkcx6JOJdOGHPem5gQp4taiCfASD8.

This key is not known by any other names.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

What's this mumbo-jumbo? Well, its just SSH saying:
> ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve never talked to gitlab.com before. I don‚Äôt know if this is really GitLab or someone pretending to be. The server is showing me a fingerprint ‚Äî do you trust it?‚Äù

This is SSH‚Äôs way of **verifying the server‚Äôs identity** before continuing. If you answer yes, SSH will save that fingerprint in your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, so it won‚Äôt ask again next time.

If you want to be sure that the fingerprint matches. Go to
[GitLab SSH host key fingerprints](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/index.html#ssh-host-keys-fingerprints) and check that the **ED25519** fingerprint matches the one you see in your terminal
