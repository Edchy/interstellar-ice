Think of React as someone else’s JavaScript code.
It’s just JavaScript that someone else wrote — a toolkit that helps you deal with certain tricky parts of building user interfaces. When i say “building user interfaces,” i mainly mean creating, updating, and managing the Document Object Model (DOM) — the part of the browser that shows buttons, text, images, forms, and everything else users interact with.

## JS - a real 90s kid
JavaScript is an old language. It wasn’t originally designed to handle complex, dynamic UIs the way we expect today.
When you’re working with vanilla JavaScript, you often have to manually find and update the parts of the page (the DOM) that need changing.
As soon as your project grows this can get very tedious and error-prone: if you forget to update one little thing, your UI can get out of sync with your application’s actual state.

React is designed to solve that problem.

Instead of manually telling the browser how to change things step-by-step (imperative programming), with React you just describe what the UI should look like based on the current state (declarative programming), and React handles the updates for you.

	•	JavaScript is imperative:
You tell it exactly what steps to take, one by one.
For example, you might say: “I want this span to show the value of count.”
Then you have to spell it out manually:
	•	Find the span
	•	Set its textContent to the value of count
	•	Update it again every time count changes
If you forget a step — like updating the span when count changes — your UI will show outdated information.

```javascript
// Imperative JavaScript
<div id="app">
  <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
  <p id="count">Clicked 0 times</p>
</div>

<script>
  let count = 0;
  const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
  const countText = document.getElementById('count');

  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    count++;
    countText.textContent = `Clicked ${count} times`;
  });
</script>
```

	•	React is declarative:
You describe what you want the UI to look like, and React figures out the steps for you.
You simply say: “This text should display the value of count.”
Whenever count changes, React automatically updates the right parts of the UI.
You don’t have to manually find elements or update them — React handles all of that behind the scenes.

```javascript
// Declarative React
import { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
      <p>Clicked {count} times</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```


I mean, it’s not really a problem if you’re building something small.
But as soon as you have multiple DOM elements depending on the same piece of state — or multiple pieces of state affecting the same DOM elements — things can get messy very quickly. The more moving parts you have, the harder it gets to keep everything in sync manually.

📚 Did You Know?

Where the words come from:
	•	Imperative comes from Latin imperare, meaning “to command”.
In imperative programming, you command the computer exactly what to do, step-by-step — like an emperor giving orders.
	•	Emperor also comes from imperare!
An emperor is literally the one who commands.
	•	Declare comes from Latin declarare, meaning “to make clear”.
Declarative programming is about making clear what you want the result to be — not how to get there.
	•	Clear comes from clarus, meaning “bright” or “easy to see”.
(So yes, declare and clear are cousins!)
