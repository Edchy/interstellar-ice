Coming in to web development in the 2020s can be really daunting, confusing, and overwhelming. There has been two decades of evolution in the web development ecosystem and alot of stuff build on top of each other, solving an ever-growing list of "problems" that evolves as the web platform is growing and maturing.

Atleast it was for me (still is). I can imagine this being alot easier for people that has been around awhile that has been able to experience the pain points first hand that these tools are trying to solve. Like, you work with vanilla JS and get to experience it's limitations. Some tool or library comes along and you understand why it was created and what problem it solves. You can then use it to make your life easier. Then some other tool comes along that builds on top of the previous one, and you can understand why it was created and what problem it solves. And so on. 

If you just get tossed in to this mess in 2025 and are told to "use React" (or any other tool) without any context, it can be really hard to understand why you have to learn so many things! 

This post is an attempt to provide some context and understanding of React, what it is, how it fits in to the web development ecosystem, and why it exists in the first place.

## The problem
In order to understand React, we first need to understand the problem it was created to solve.
But before we do that, let’s take a quick detour into how the web actually works. When you visit a website, the server sends HTML to your browser. The browser turns that HTML into a [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) — a live, interactive version of the page — then renders it to the screen. Any time the DOM changes, the browser re-renders the affected parts of the page (it's sort of smart about what parts need to re-render).

### Imperative vs Declarative Programming
We also need to understand the difference between imperative and declarative programming, because this is a key concept in React and often mentioned in the context of web development.

#### Imperative programming 
Is when you tell the computer exactly how to do something, step by step. You give it a sequence of commands to follow. For example, imagine you have this HTML and JS:
```html
<article>
  <h2>counter</h2>
  <p>You clicked the button <span id="count">0</span> times</p>
  <button onclick="setCount()">Click me</button>
</article>
```
```javascript
const countText = document.getElementById('count');

function setCount() {
  let count = Number(countText.textContent);
  count++;
  countText.textContent = count;
}
```
The code above is imperative because it tells the browser exactly what to do, step by step:
1. Find the `<span>` element with the ID `count`.
2. Get its current text content and convert it to a number.
3. Increment that number by 1.
4. Set the `<span>`'s text content to the new number.

##### JavaScript a real 90s kid
JavaScript is an old language. It wasn’t originally designed to handle complex, dynamic UIs the way we expect today.
In traditional JavaScript, you’re in charge of every step the browser takes to update the UI. You write the logic: find an element, update its content, maybe toggle a class or adjust some styles. If you’ve tried this yourself, you know how quickly it gets tedious—and fragile—as your app grows.

For something simple, like a single counter, vanilla JavaScript is totally fine. But things start to fall apart once your UI becomes more dynamic.

Imagine instead of one counter, you have 10. Or _50_. Or maybe you have several buttons that all affect the same count, and that count appears in multiple places across the page. Now, every time the state (in this case, the count) changes, you have to manually update every part of the DOM that depends on it.

And if you forget just one of those updates? Your UI is now out of sync with your data.

This is where traditional JS gets messy. You end up writing a lot of imperative code — do this, then that, then update this, unless that changed too—and it becomes hard to keep track of what your UI should actually look like at any given moment.

##### Why This Is a Problem

The root issue is that your application’s state lives in the DOM — in the text content of an element, or in attributes, or maybe even in the class names. That makes your app harder to reason about, because you’re scattering the source of truth across a bunch of different DOM nodes.

This setup is:
- Unpredictable – You don’t always know which parts of the UI reflect which pieces of state.
- Manual – You’re responsible for remembering to update everything, everywhere.
- Bug-prone – Forget one DOM update, and your UI is out of sync.
- Hard to scale – As the number of interactive elements grows, your code becomes harder to maintain and debug.

#### Declarative programming 
Is when you describe what you want the computer to do, without specifying the exact steps to get there. You just say what the end result should look like, and let the computer figure out how to achieve it.

Let's take the imperative example above:
```html
<article>
  <h2>counter</h2>
  <p>You clicked the button <span id="count">0</span> times</p>
  <button onclick="setCount()">Click me</button>
</article>
```
```javascript
const countText = document.getElementById('count');

function setCount() {
  let count = Number(countText.textContent);
  count++;
  countText.textContent = count;
}
```
and try to rewrite it in a declarative way:
```html
<article>
  <h2>counter</h2>
  <p>You clicked the button <span id="count">0</span> times</p>
  <button onclick="setCount()">Click me</button>
</article>
```
```javascript
const countApp = {
  getCount: () => {
    const countElement = document.getElementById('count');
    return Number(countElement.textContent);
  }
  setCount: (newCount) => {
    const countElement = document.getElementById('count');
    countElement.textContent = newCount;
  },
}

function setCount() {
  let count = countApp.getCount();
  countApp.setCount(count + 1);
}
```

Right away, you can see that this is already more code than a basic onclick handler — but there’s a reason for that.

We’ve created a little abstraction, `countApp`, to handle the low-level logic: finding DOM elements and updating them. Then we use a function, `setCount`, that simply says: “increment the count.” This function is declarative — it describes what we want to happen, not how to do it in DOM terms.

Now imagine this abstraction (countApp) lives in a separate file or is installed from an npm package:
```javascript
import { countApp } from 'count-app';

function setCount() {
  let count = countApp.getCount();
  countApp.setCount(count + 1);
}
```
Notice how clean that looks. We’re no longer working with the DOM directly—we’re just calling functions. We’ve moved from imperative DOM manipulation to declarative intent.
{/* Notice how we no longer are telling the browser how to get and set the count. We are simply using the `countApp` object, which is an abstraction that handles the imperative logic for us. On a high level, this is exactly what React does. It allows you to write declarative code that describes what the UI should look like, without having to manually manipulate the DOM step by step. And so, in this example, we can think of `countApp` as a very simple version of React. */}

(note. the code examples are taken from [Tony Alicea's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKvVyC6si0&t=20419s) excellent YouTube video on React, which I highly recommend watching for a deeper understanding of these concepts.)

## So What is React?

React is basically the same idea — but way more powerful and sophisticated.

Just like countApp abstracted away DOM manipulation for one element, React abstracts DOM creation and updates for your entire UI. You describe what the UI should look like, and React takes care of how to make it happen in the browser. And at the end of the day, it’s still just JavaScript code. **Imperative** code that some smart people wrote to handle the low-level details of the DOM for you.

And here’s a very important concept:
**Declarative code** is always built on **top** of **imperative code.**

When you write React code, you’re writing on top of someone else’s imperative logic — just like how you wrote setCount on top of countApp.

An often used metaphor (which i find quite good) is that imperative code is like driving a manual transmission car: you control everything — gears, clutch, timing. It gives you full control, but it’s easy to stall or make a mistake. Whereas declarative code is like using an automatic transmission. You tell the car, “I want to go forward,” and the system figures out how. Under the hood, someone still wrote imperative logic to make that work — you just don’t have to deal with it directly.



<InfoBox title="Did You Know?">
Imperative comes from Latin imperare, meaning “to command”.
In imperative programming, you command the computer exactly what to do, step-by-step — like an emperor giving orders.
	•	Emperor also comes from imperare!

An emperor is literally the one who commands.
	•	Declare comes from Latin declarare, meaning “to make clear”.
Declarative programming is about making clear what you want the result to be — not how to get there.
	•	Clear comes from clarus, meaning “bright” or “easy to see”.
Clear declare are basically cousins.
