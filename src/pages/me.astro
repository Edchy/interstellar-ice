      Hey, I'm Eddie. <strong><em>CEO</em></strong> of <strong
        ><em>Nope Studio</em></strong
      > ‚Äî a fictitious, entirely made-up web agency that exists mostly in my head
      and sometimes on my r√©sum√©.
    </p>

    <p>
      It‚Äôs been about three years since I tripped into the wonderfully chaotic
      world of web development. Since then, I‚Äôve picked up a few things ‚Äî like
      <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a mild <em>caffeine addiction</em>, and an
      unhealthy number of tabs open at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
      This field moves fast. There‚Äôs always some shiny new framework, library,
      tool, or acronym promising to <em>‚Äúchange the game.‚Äù</em> And hey, some of
      them might actually do. But people seem to pick a tech stack and defend it
      like it‚Äôs their childhood dog (<em>tribalism, yay</em>). <strong
        >React or die. Tailwind or fail. Vue? Never met her.</strong
      > But I try not to get too attached. I like staying
      <strong>flexible</strong>, <strong>curious</strong>, <strong
        >skeptical</strong
      >, and exploring what‚Äôs out there, and understanding why things are built
      the way they are. Doing deep dives when something interests me. That‚Äôs
      kinda my thing ‚Äî I don‚Äôt marry frameworks,
      <em>I date around</em>.
    </p>

      Flashback to Summer 2022: I was in a rut, mentally checked out of a job I
      didn‚Äôt care about, quietly spiraling into a YouTube abyss. Then I stumbled
      upon <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"
        >freeCodeCamp</a
      >. I had no clue what a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> was. But I was intrigued. I
      started watching videos, reading articles, and before I knew it, I was knee-deep
      in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong
        >JavaScript</strong
      >. I was <em>hooked</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="x">
      Fast forward to today: Two educations later (<em
        >yes, plural‚Äîbecause why do things halfway?</em
      > (also they were quite short)), countless hours of coding, debugging, crying,
      Googling error messages, asking my robot buddys for help, and more crying...
      I can confidently say: <strong>this is it</strong>. I <strong
        >love building</strong
      >. I <strong>love solving problems</strong>. I <em>love the flow state</em
      >. I <strong>love creating something from nothing</strong>. And above all,
      I love the feeling of <em
        >not knowing something... and figuring it out anyway</em
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I can proudly tell my Mama that <strong><em>AI</em> did it!</strong> Jesus,
      I mean <strong>I</strong> did it (<em>schh, stupid Copilot tab</em>).
      Fine... <strong>we</strong> did it.
    </p>

    <p>
      That‚Äôs us...me! <strong>Developer(s)</strong>. <strong
        >Problem-solver(s)</strong
      >. <em>Occasional existential-crisis-haver(s)</em>. (can you please stop
      adding those <em>S's</em> Bobby!).
